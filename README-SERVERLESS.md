# Config Lambda Functions in Astro project

To know about Astro, [README.md](https://github.com/devrebeleza/week4-common-layout/blob/master/README.md)

## Netlify Functions

...adds an entire serverless development and deployment pipeline to your project as part of your existing workflow, so we can use serverless functions to provide back-end services for our project.

### Using default connection

We need netlify-cli package and config some files

```
npm install netlify-cli -global
```

add [netlify.toml file](https://github.com/devrebeleza/week4-common-layout/blob/config-serverless/netlify.toml)
The netlify.toml is a configuration file that specifies how Netlify builds and deploys your site â€” including redirects, branch and context-specific settings, and more. [more info](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/file-based-configuration/)

modify [package.json file](https://github.com/devrebeleza/week4-common-layout/blob/config-serverless/package.json)

we need to change a command in package.json to start our project.
this `"start": "astro dev"`, to this `"start": "netlify dev"`

### Using express

if we want to use express to handle our http request, we need express and serverles-http packages

```
npm install express --save
npm install serverless-http -global
```

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of our Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files (just show that we need):

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ functions/
â”‚ 		â”œâ”€â”€ hello.js  (default connection)
â”‚ 		â”œâ”€â”€ login.js  (express connection)
â”‚ 		â””â”€â”€ signup.js (express connection)
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚ 		â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚ 		    â”œâ”€â”€ login.astro
â”‚ 		    â”œâ”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚ 		    â””â”€â”€ signup.astro
â”œâ”€â”€ netlify.toml (new)
â””â”€â”€ package.json (modified)
```

### Extra feature

Currently if we want to acces our Netlify Functions, we need to acces `/.netlify/functions/<function_name>` and this is not user-friendly.
We can do a redirect to improve it!
This can be done with a file called `_redirects` in the publish directory of your site.
Or (my choice) change the `netlify.toml` file by adding:

> [[redirects]]
>       from = "/api/\*"
>       to = "/.netlify/functions/:splat"
>       status = 200

f you've used Netlify Functions before, you may know that one way to trigger them is to visit your site with the path /.netlify/functions/<your function name>. However, if you wanted to expose your functions as an API, this doesn't look super user-friendly. Instead, we can use redirects to improve it!

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
| Command | Action |
| :--------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| `npm run start ` | Start local dev server at `localhost:3000` |
|                  |             and Server on `localhost:8888` |
